#### tldr ðŸ“–
Computer Science is super interesting  </br>
My dev interests are smooth operations, scaling, observability, System Design and Machine Learning.

* Studying for my master's degree in Data Science.
* Working with mostly opensource self-hosted tools </br> as R&D DevOps Engineer in the Telecom sector for a non-profit.

#### What 2024 will bring me (won't accomplish everything probably and its fine!) ðŸŒ±

* Improving at Data Structures and Algorithms
* Better System Design skills
* Learning Go [If thats a goals of yours too I suggest starting from learning Go with TDD!] [[-]](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)
* A GCP certification
* Switching to Pytorch
* Working with impactful machine learning applications
* Delve into recommending systems
* A deeper understanding of GenAI
